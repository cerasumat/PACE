	/// <code>Heartbeat</code> is used to log data that happens in a regular intervals,for example once per second,
	/// such as system load, CPU percentage, memory usage, thread pool statistics, cache hit/miss rate, service manifest etc.
	/// and even some configuration could be carried by <code>Heartbeat</code>. There could be some good use cases, for example
	/// health checker and load balancer, that make good use of it.
	/// 
	/// <code>Heartbeat</code> should never be used per request since the request is not regular predictable, 
	/// instead it could be logged in a daemon background thread, or something like a Timer.
	/// 
	/// All message will be constructed as a message tree and send to back-end for further analysis, and for monitoring.
	/// Only <code>ITransaction</code> can be a tree node, all other message will be the tree leaf.
	/// The transaction without	other messages nested is an atomic transaction.
